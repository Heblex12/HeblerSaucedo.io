       <h3>"All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream" - Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
       <p class="des">My name is Hebler Saucedo Campos, I was born in Guerrero Mexico. In locations that I was born there 
        wasn’t a lot of technology, I didn’t know about the computer until I made the trip to the United States. I 
        learn how to use computer and learn how they could make life easier and can things that seem imposible 
        possible. After this technology became my passion and I knew with technology we can create a change. 
        
        I am currently Majoring in Interactive Media and Design at the University of Washington Bothell. My 
        focus is web development because I love making people ideas into a reality and making their jobs easier. 
        Through web design and web development we can make information easier to access and create new 
        unique experience for the user. I am very passionate about learning something an challenging. My hobbies 
        are playing video games, hiking, playing sport such as basketball soccer anything fun. </p>
